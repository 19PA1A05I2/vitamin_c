            <ul class="xyz">
                <li>Low levels of red blood cells in people with a long-term illness (anemia of chronic disease). Taking vitamin C supplements might help manage anemia in people undergoing dialysis.</li>
                   <li>Irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). Taking vitamin C for a few days before and after heart surgery helps prevent irregular heartbeat after heart surgery. </li>
                   <li>Common cold. There is some controversy about the effectiveness of vitamin C for treating the common cold. However, most research shows that taking 1-3 grams of vitamin C might shorten the course of the cold by 1 to 1.5 days. Taking vitamin C does not appear to prevent colds.
                </li>
                <li>Airway infections caused by exercise. Using vitamin C before heavy physical exercise, such as a marathon or army training, might prevent upper airway infections that can occur after heavy exercise.
                </li>
                <li>Wrinkled skin. Skin creams containing vitamin C seem to improve the appearance of wrinkled skin. A vitamin C patch also seems to help reduce wrinkles.
